         <li>3 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour</li>
         <li>180 ml (3/4 cup) beef stock</li>
         <li>120 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable stock</li>
         <li>120 ml (1/2 cup) double (heavy) cream</li>
         <li>2 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
         <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
         <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
         <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>To Serve:</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
         <li>creamy mashed potato</li>
         <li>lingonberry jam or redcurrant jelly</li>
         <li>green veg</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>First, make the meatballs. Place the beef mince, pork mince, diced onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, salt, black pepper, white pepper, and allspice in a bowl.</li>
         <li>Mix it altogether with your hands, then form into 18-22 meatballs.</li>
         <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium-high heat until hot.</li>
         <li>Add half of the meatballs to the pan, and fry, turning occasionally, until browned all over. Transfer the meatballs to a tray.</li>
         <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan and cook the second batch of meatballs in the same way, then transfer to the tray with the other meatballs.</li>
         <li>Place the tray in the oven on low (150C/300F (fan)) to finish cooking through while you make the sauce (they only need 5 or 6 minutes).</li>
         <li>Now start on the sauce. Add the butter to the pan that you cooked the meatballs in. Turn the heat down to medium and melt the butter.</li>
         <li>Add the flour and whisk it into the butter to form a roux (thick paste).</li>
         <li>Add the beef stock a splash at a time, whilst stirring with the whisk, until fully combined with the butter-flour mixture and no lumps remain.</li>
         <li>Stir in the vegetable stock and bring to the boil.</li>
         <li>Add the cream, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and salt and stir together to combine.</li>
         <li>Add the meatballs back to the pan along with any resting liquid from the tray.</li>
         <li>Stir together to coat the meatballs in the sauce and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, then serve.</li>
         <li>I like to serve my meatballs with creamy mashed potato, lingonberry jam, and green veggies, all topped off with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and black pepper.</li>
